# World_Weather_Analysis
## Overview

PlanMyTrip app recommended a few changes to take the app to the next level. Specifically, they recommend adding the weather description to the weather data.

## Process

I used the weather description data I retrieved to enhance the PlanMyTrip app. Then, I filter the data for weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. 

The beta tester will choose four cities from the list of potential travel destinations to create a travel itinerary. Finally, using the Geoapify Routing API, I created a travel route between the four cities and a marker layer map.
